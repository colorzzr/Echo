# Begin
In arduino the `main` function has already set up

We now writing the two functions `setup()` and	`loop()`

### Setup

The `setup()`function is called when a sketch starts. Use it to initialize variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc. 

The setup function will only run once, after each powerup or reset of the Arduino board.

### Loop

The `Loop()` function would run infinity times

And main command codes are written here
