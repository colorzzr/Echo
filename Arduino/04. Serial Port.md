# Serial Port

`Serial` is the class that can print something on the Serial monitor

which is at the top left of Arduino 

`Serial.begin(int transferSpeed)` is to tell serial I want to transfer the data at this speed

!!Remember the transfer speed need to match the speed in Serial monitor

and it would be initial once

`Serial.print(string)` would print the string without `endl`

`Serial.println(string)` would print the string with `endl`

`Serial.available()` would return 1 if user input data or return 0

`Serial.parserInt()` would get `int` type for variable
